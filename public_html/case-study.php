								<h1>It’s hard to fix a problem no one can see.</h1>
								<p>In the Madison area alone, there are nearly 1000 homeless families. And in 2013, at least 400 Dane County families (including 775 children) couldn’t find room in a community shelter. The numbers are stunning—at least, they surprised our Goodstock team. But The Road Home staff understood. It seems homeless families aren’t that easy to see.</p>
								<p>When the shelters are full, homeless families seek out quiet, hidden places to protect their kids from judgment and harm. They sleep in cars, hole up in empty buildings; you don’t often see families living on the streets. And that presented a challenge for The Road Home Dane County. To help an ever-increasing number of homeless children and their families, the organization needed to drive support for a cause that very few people are aware of.</p>
								<p>KW2 had it’s mission. We needed to make an invisible problem visible in 24 hours, give or take.</p>

								<h1>Creating a window into homelessness.</h1>
								<p>The Road Home needed a marketing plan that could make the most of their limited budget and an advertising campaign capable of bringing the realities of childhood and family homelessness into focus. Isolation, uncertainty, shuffling endlessly from place to place—these poignant truths would speak for themselves. But to increase donations, we’d have to do more than make an emotional connection to the cause. We’d need to build brand recognition. We’d have to make The Road Home’s name the central idea of our television spot.</p>
								<p>The clock was ticking. With Goodstock partner Nick Berard behind the lens and just a few hours of available light, our creative team searched out Madison’s hidden corners and abandoned spaces. Wisconsin’s dreary winter weather helped, adding a visible chill to each location.</p>

								<h1>Donors increased by 35%.</h1>
								<p>With the help of generous partners, our Goodstock give included a strategic marketing plan, television spot, print ads and out-of-home creative for The Road Home, plus 450 minutes of free airtime and 4 free insertion in Madison’s biggest local publications.</p>
								<p>It all worked. Boosting The Road Home’s visibility increased donors and donations in the year that followed. Their donor pool grew by 35%—a 12% jump in new donors over the previous year—and Individual contributions rose by $19,000 between 2014 and 2015.</p>

								<p>But underneath the clean layout and easy-to-use tools, there’s a powerful information engine at work. Making sure every Wisconsin voter receives the personal, up-to-date information they need wasn’t easy. To ensure always-accurate results, KW2 worked with a team of talented development partners to build a robust database system capable of parsing a state’s worth of complex, secured data—including voter registration status, election dates, polling place locations, ballot designs and more.</p>
