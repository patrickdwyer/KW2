					<h2 class="subtitle text-center">Here’s what we believe.</h2>
					<p>Great work and great relationships are born from shared understanding. When an agency’s culture complements the client’s culture—when their definitions of success and collaboration fundamentally agree—that’s when two organizations start performing as one.</p>
					<p>Understanding like that takes work and willingness. But KW2 always puts in the time. Starting with the arrival of your Common Cup, throughout our immersive <a href="#">onboarding</a> and the creative process, we’ll work side-by-side to find your difference. To distill your intangible value. And to create the sort of intelligently <a href="#" class="annotation">disruptive ›</a> communications that will fire your customers’ imaginations and set your competition back on their heels.</p>
					<p>For 30 years, KW2 has helped leading organizations—like Berkshire Hathaway, Lands’ End, Schwinn and both the University of and State of Wisconsin—create stories and <a href="#">experiences that build delight, loyalty and love</a>.</p>
